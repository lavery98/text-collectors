# Text collector scripts

These are scripts that I use with the Node Exporter Textfile Collector on my servers.

Each script has a header which explains what it does and how to use it.

It is recommended to use `sponge` to atomically write the output. This utility comes from the [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/) package

More scripts can be found in the prometheus community text collector repository here: https://github.com/prometheus-community/node-exporter-textfile-collector-scripts
